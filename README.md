# Project C: The Clouds  
**Version:** 0.1.3.6 | **Stage:** Prototype (Iterations 1 and 2-B completed)
## Whole project: [TheGravity](https://thegravity.ru) & [TheClouds](https://thegravity.ru/project-c/)

---

## Core Idea  
A passion-driven experimental game blending **Studio Ghibli's visual style**, **procedural cloud generation**, and **modular development**. Focuses on **contemplative gameplay** and **technical experimentation**, not commercial goals.  

---

## Visual Style  
- **References:**  
  - [Concept art and animations](https://imgur.com/a/tKPcc2U).  
  - Studio Ghibli aesthetics + gradient painting + outline effects + glow.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Frame-by-frame hand-drawn VFX animations.  
  - Low-poly clouds/static elements inspired by Studio Ghibli.  

---

## Gameplay  
### Core Mechanics  
1. **Exploration:**  
   - Fly through procedurally generated cloud layers (static, animated, stormy).  
   - Day/night cycle and weather effects (rain, thunderstorms).  
2. **Interaction:**  
   - Control characters (fox, birds, airships).  
   - Collect items, customize vehicles.  

---

## Development Plan by Iterations  
### Iteration 1: Cloud Simulator  
**Status:** âœ… Completed  
**Goals:**  
- [x] Procedural generation of 10+ cloud types (cirrus, cumulus, storm clouds).  
- [x] Day/night cycle.  
- [x] Photo mode.  

**Tech:**  
- Unreal Engine 5 + Niagara.  
- Free camera control (`SpectatorPawn`).

### Iteration 2-B: Tails of the Fox  
**Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress  
**Goals:**  
- [ ] Character locomotion (running, flying).  
- [x] 2-player co-op (P2P).  
- [ ] Inventory and collection system.  

**Gameplay:**  
- Explore to collect items.  
- Simple puzzles.  

---

### Iteration 2-A: Flight Simulator  
**Status:** ðŸ“… Planned  
**Goals:**  
- [ ] 2500+ km vertical world for high-altitude flight.  
- [ ] Vehicle-cloud interaction (e.g., contrails).  

**Gameplay:**  
- Third-person flight.  
- Cosmetic vehicle customization.  

---

### Iteration 3: Sky Trading  
**Status:** ðŸ“… Planned  
**Goals:**  
- Dynamic economy (supply/demand).  
- Trade missions between static locations.  

---

## Technical Details  
### Engine & Platforms  
- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5 (C++/Blueprints).  
- **Platforms:** PC (primary), Android (in development).  

### Requirements  
| Platform | Minimum | Recommended |  
|----------|---------|-------------|
